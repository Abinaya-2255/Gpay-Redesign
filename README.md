DESCRIPTION: THIS PROJECT IS MY TASK 3 SUBMISSION FOR THE CODTECH INTERNSHIP, WHERE I WAS ASSIGNED TO CHOOSE A POPULAR MOBILE APPLICATION AND REDESIGN ITS UI/UX TO ADDRESS A SPECIFIC PAIN POINT. FOR THIS TASK, I SELECTED THE GOOGLE PAY HOME SCREEN BECAUSE ITS CURRENT INTERFACE, AS SEEN IN THE BEFORE IMAGE, FEELS VISUALLY CROWDED AND FILLED WITH TOO MANY ACTION ICONS THAT CAN OVERWHELM USERS, ESPECIALLY NEW ONES. THE ORIGINAL LAYOUT PRESENTS A LARGE NUMBER OF PAYMENT OPTIONS, SMALL ICONS, MULTIPLE ROWS OF FEATURES, AND LIMITED VISUAL HIERARCHY, WHICH MAKES IT HARD FOR USERS TO QUICKLY IDENTIFY KEY ACTIONS LIKE PAY, SCAN, OR CHECK HISTORY. MY REDESIGN FOCUSES ON SIMPLIFYING THE HOME EXPERIENCE BY PRIORITIZING THE MOST IMPORTANT FUNCTIONS AND REDUCING COGNITIVE LOAD THROUGH A CLEANER, MORE MODERN VISUAL APPROACH. IN THE REDESIGNED VERSION, I INTRODUCED A CLEAR TOP SEARCH BAR, FOLLOWED BY THREE PRIMARY ACTION BUTTONS — SCAN, PAY TO PHONE, AND HISTORY — WHICH NOW STAND OUT AS THE MAIN INTERACTIVE ELEMENTS. THIS IMPROVES SCANNABILITY AND GIVES USERS A MORE INTUITIVE STARTING POINT. I ALSO REDESIGNED THE RECENT PAYMENTS SECTION BY USING LARGER, VISIBLE PROFILE IMAGES AND A SIMPLE HORIZONTAL CAROUSEL, MAKING IT EASY TO FIND FREQUENT CONTACTS WITHOUT NAVIGATING THROUGH MULTIPLE OPTIONS. THE BILLS AND RECHARGES SECTION WAS CONSOLIDATED INTO CLEAN, MINIMAL CARDS WITH CLEAR ICONS AND SOFT COLORS, CREATING A FRIENDLY, LESS CLUTTERED VISUAL APPEARANCE. OVERALL SPACING, ALIGNMENT, AND TYPOGRAPHY WERE REFINED TO CREATE A PREMIUM, FINTECH-READY LOOK THAT FEELS MORE FOCUSED AND USER-CENTERED. THE DESIGN DECISIONS WERE MADE WITH THE GOAL OF IMPROVING USABILITY, SPEEDING UP TASK COMPLETION, AND MINIMIZING DISTRACTION BY REMOVING UNNECESSARY VISUAL NOISE. THE REDESIGN ALSO STAYS TRUE TO THE FAMILIAR GOOGLE PAY AESTHETIC WHILE INTRODUCING A CALMER, MORE STRUCTURED LAYOUT THAT NEW USERS CAN UNDERSTAND INSTANTLY. THIS PROJECT WAS CREATED USING FIGMA, WHERE I BUILT ALL SCREENS, COMPONENTS, ICON ARRANGEMENTS, AND USER FLOWS FROM SCRATCH. THROUGH THIS EXERCISE, I PRACTICED MOBILE RESPONSIVE THINKING, HIERARCHY CREATION, MODERN UI STYLING, AND PAIN POINT IDENTIFICATION. THIS REDESIGN SHOWS HOW EVEN A SINGLE SCREEN CAN BE DRAMATICALLY IMPROVED BY FOCUSING ON SIMPLICITY, CLARITY, AND USER NEEDS. IT ALSO DEMONSTRATES MY ABILITY TO ANALYZE AN EXISTING INTERFACE, IDENTIFY SPECIFIC PROBLEMS, AND DELIVER A MORE STREAMLINED, ENGAGING, AND USER-FRIENDLY VERSION WHILE KEEPING BRAND FAMILIARITY INTACT. THIS SUBMISSION REPRESENTS MY APPROACH TO PRACTICAL UI/UX IMPROVEMENT AND REFLECTS MY UNDERSTANDING OF MOBILE EXPERIENCE DESIGN AND VISUAL REFINEMENT.
